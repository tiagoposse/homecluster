Kubernetes cluster creation and management using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) , [Helmsman](https://github.com/Praqma/helmsman) and Drone CI/CD (https://www.drone.io).

# Structure

`apps/ #Â Holds the cluster-tool and dyndns sync script made for this repo, more info on each app's readme
charts/ # Custom charts and the values for all charts used in this repo.
resources/ # k8s resources that are required for the charts, that are not included in the initial chart
setup/ # ansible playbooks to install the cluster`

# Notes about this repo
- The final idea is for this repo to hold only the k3s cluster creation, as easy and configurable as possible, only the setup/ folder will stay, the rest will move to its own repo.

# Updating cluster version

Update the value versions.k3s on cluster/group_vars/all.yml and re-run k3s playbook. Autodownloading the kube config is not yet done.
